			While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Angelina Jolie</a>
			and<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Brad Pitt</a>  became star-crossed lovers, Mr. & Mrs. Smith deserves
			more attention than your typical A-list action movie. In particular,
			the film’s trenchant critique of suburbia, marriage, and the lies we tell
			each other every day make it a relevant, contemporary movie.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			As the film is now almost 10 years old,
			I will be revealing some mild spoilers
			in this review, but it should not be enough
			to disturb enjoyment of the movie.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>A Slow Death In Suburbia</b></p>

		<br>

		<p>
			The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt)
			and Jane (Jolie) Smith features them in the modern
			suburban torture chamber: therapy in the office of
			a marriage counselor. While denying that they need
			any kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup” John
			it is obvious that they are deeply uncomfortable in
			each other’s presence, a rawness helped by the fact
			that this was the first scene shot in the film.<a href="#bottom">*</a>
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			As told in flashback, the couple originally met
			under dramatic and emotionally heightened circumstances
			in Panama, framing both their attraction and the cause of
			their self-destruction. Each is an assassin for a rival
			company, but instinctively uses their cover as a civilian
			contractor from the moment they meet, successfully fooling
			each other for the first six years of their relationship.
			It is this same deceit that threatens the end of their marriage.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			In this way the film is very similar to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/">True Lies</a>,
			the action-comedy film directed 10 years earlier by
			James Cameron. However, in that film the deceit was
			almost entirely one-sided, the manipulation significantly
			more disturbing, and (being a Cameron- Schwarzenegger film)
			focused much more on spectacle.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			While seeing each other as equals, it quickly
			becomes apparent that John and Jane are very
			different people. Jane is reserved, precise,
			analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble
			, raw and improvisational. Every remaining bit of their
			energy is devoted to maintaining a successful cover: a
			fine house, the latest model cars. But it is only in danger
			and risk that they come alive: life in suburbia is boredom
			and ennui, and it’s clear that they can’t wait to escape the
			prison they have built for themselves each day.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Marching Orders</b></p>

		<p>
			When their respective employers discover who
			they work for, John and Jane are set to kill
			each other. While these first attempts fail,
			the seething resentment of both wife and husband
			fuels a series of mounting revenge attacks. Their
			destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see them
			actually enjoying themselves in competition with each
			other – and ultimately frees them from the web of lies
			they have spun.
		</p>

		<br>

		<br>

		<p>
			Having failed in eliminating their rival,
			the previously inimical companies contracting
			John and Jane temporarily put aside their differences
			to end the problem of the Smiths, driving them closer
			together in survival instinct. The last third of the
			movie is the fight of John and Jane against the joined
			forces of their companies, culminating in a final showdown
			reminiscent of the climax in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid</a>.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

		<br>

		<p>
			While it is not without its faults
			(in particular <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681/">Vincent Vaughn’s</a> misogynistic, eternally frustrated
			character has become all too familiar in too many movies), Mr. & Mrs.
			Smith also has a significant share of charm. The chemistry between Pitt
			and Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences
			with a barded critique of modern suburban life, and it remains, on the whole,
			one of my favorite films.

		<p>
			<a name="bottom">*</a> (Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically:
			I was feel that doing so imparts an extra emotional
			verisimilitude to an actor’s performance, as they can express
			the emotional arc of their character in the same sequence that
			the audience experiences it.
